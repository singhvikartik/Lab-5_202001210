Aim - To do Static Analysis using the tools 

//Static analysis tools are software tools that analyze the source code of a program without
executing it. They can help developers find and fix errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and
other quality issues in their code. Static analysis tools can also measure various metrics of the
code, such as complexity, readability, maintainability, test coverage, and documentation. Static
analysis tools can be integrated into the development process as part of the code editor, the
version control system, or the continuous integration pipeline. Some examples of static analysis
tools are SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, and Pylint// 

I have used Pyflakes as Static analysis tool. 

1) Pyflakes can be installed via pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt
    Command - "pip install pyflakes"

2) The file I used for analysis

3) Once Pyflakes is installed, you can use it to analyze your Python code. To run Pyflakes on a specific Python file, navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the following command  "pyflakes [file_name] to analyse the code

4) Pyflakes will output any errors or warnings it finds in the code. If Pyflakes does not output anything, it means there were no errors found. If there are errors, they will be displayed in the following format which I have analysed in the above image

In the code, the errors were 
1) Invalid Syntax in both the cases

The error messages indicate that there are invalid syntax errors in the code:

In "detection.py" on line 13, the code contains the C-style comment syntax " // " instead of Python's "#" to comment out the line. You can replace " // " with "#" to fix this error.

In "recog2.py" on line 7, the code contains a typo in the "import" statement. It should be "import" instead of "impor". You can fix this error by replacing "impor" with "import".
